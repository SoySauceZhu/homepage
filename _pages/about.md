## About

Hi, I’m **Mingjie Zhu**. Also welcomed to call me **Jay**.

I’m a Computer Science & Electronic Engineering student with a strong interest in **AI systems**, **machine learning for scientific data**, and **system-level engineering**.

My work focuses on building and understanding systems end-to-end, from algorithms and data representations, to software architecture and real-world constraints. I enjoy projects where theory meets implementation, especially those involving signal processing, distributed services, and ML-driven modeling.

I care about **clarity over cleverness**, **structure over hacks**, and designs that remain understandable and reliable over time. I prefer building things that work in practice, not just in demos.

I'm applying for MS programme in ECE and CS fields, and looking for lab opportunities. 

### Interests
- AI Infrastructure & Intelligent Systems  
- Machine Learning for Scientific / Physical Data  
- Signal Processing & Representation Learning  
- Distributed Systems & Engineering Design  

### Currently
- Exploring ML-assisted modeling and data-driven analysis  
- Building modular AI agents and backend systems  
- Preparing for graduate study in CS / ECE  

If you’re interested in thoughtful system design, applied ML, or engineering with real constraints, feel free to explore my projects.
